# Phase 4 Plan Review — Skipped

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Reason:** Pre-execution review skipped — standard delivery phase (Phase 4: Dual Adapter Validation). Post-execution review will be run.

Per `PHASE_REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md`, pre-execution reviews are optional for standard delivery phases (4, 5, 7, 8, 10) and mandatory only for review gates (3, 6, 11) and novel-architecture phases (9).
