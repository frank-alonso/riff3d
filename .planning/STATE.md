## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Contracts-first build order (specs before any UI) per FOUNDATION.md
- [Roadmap]: PlayCanvas as primary adapter through Phase 1-2; Babylon.js as validation in Phase 4
- [Roadmap]: Review gates at Phase 3, 6, and 11 to validate foundation before building on it
- [Roadmap]: Yjs CRDTs for collaboration (not Colyseus) per research recommendation

### Pending Todos

- [Phase 8] Re-evaluate `.planning/research/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_PLAYBOOK.md` — reconcile archetype specs with actual component registry, validate against built game runtime, update playtest process, finalize template backlog. Also review at Phase 7 (latency budgets) and Phase 10 (VR variants).

### Blockers/Concerns
